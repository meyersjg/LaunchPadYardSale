Code challenge for LaunchPad Lab

LaunchPadYardSale is a simple app that allows LaunchPad to sell their old furniture.

I decided to add three models: Product, Order, and Admin. An Order belongs_to a Product and a Product has_one Order. These two models are associated by product_id as the foreign key. There is no users model- all of the buyers information is tied to an instance of Order.

There are only four screens in this app. An index of all of the products LaunchPad has for sale (homepage), a new order screen, the admin login screen, and the admin dashboard.

Originally I wrote a method in the Order model
