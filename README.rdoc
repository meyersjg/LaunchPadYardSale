Code challenge for LaunchPad Lab

LaunchPadYardSale is a simple app that allows LaunchPad to sell their old furniture.

I created three models: Product, Order, and Admin. An Order belongs_to a Product and a Product has_one Order. These two models are associated by product_id as the foreign key. There is no users model- all of the buyers information is tied to an instance of Order.

There are only four screens in this app. An index of all of the products LaunchPad has for sale (homepage), a new order screen, the admin login screen, and the admin dashboard. There are two tabs on the admin dashboard: All Orders and Add Product. All Orders displays all of the orders that have been placed. Add Product is a form that adds a new product to the index.

The product_id is passed to the new order form via the params hash. Once the order is placed, the product corresponding to that product_id gets destroyed. This follows the assumption that every product on the products#index is a one-off product and can only be purchased once.
